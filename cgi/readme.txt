
This directory contains cgi scripts for use with a web server
like Apache.

You will probably need to edit the first line to provide the
correct python path.

You may also need to modify the contents of skimpyCGIconfig.py
and create directories mentioned there.

If the cgi scripts do not work under unix, the line endings may
be messed up.  Try converting them using the changeToUnixLineEndings.py
script.
