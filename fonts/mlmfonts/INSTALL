1. Unpack the file mlmfonts.tar.gz into your personal or system-wide font
directory, referred hereafter as DIR (on Linux, the typical system-wide
directory is /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/). This will create a subdirectory
DIR/MLM.

2. Add this sudirectory to your personal font path by adding

xset fp+ DIR/MLM

to your personal .xinitrc, .xsession, .Xclients or whatever the X startup
file is called on your system.

Alternatively, for system-wide use (assuming Linux and XFree86):

(a) if your XFree startup file, typically /etc/X11/XF86Config or
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config, has something like

    FontPath   "unix/:7100"

then find the font server config file, typically /etc/X11/fs/config or
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fs/config, and add DIR/MLM to the list of font
directories there.

(b) Or, if FontPath in the XF86Config file actually lists the font
directories, add this one there.


3. To use these fonts, e.g., for xterm, type, e.g., 'xterm -fn monosimple'
(the aliases as defined in the file fonts.aliases are: monosimple, monoell,
proposimple, propell, rusclean13, rusclean15).

Or, for xemacs, add to your .Xdefaults (or whatever your file with X
resources is called):

XEmacs.default.attributeFont:  -*-proposimple-*

(for other fonts, use your favorite font selection tool and look for 'mlm'
and 'shumacherrus' foundry names).

These fonts are in koi8-r encoding. In addition, the file fonts.alias
creates aliases for them to be (mis)used as iso8859-1 (Western), so they may
be selected in Netscape for that encoding as well. This is needed for
viewing many Russian web pages.

The file fonts.alias also defines bold and normal faces to be the same face
(because I did not write bold versions).
