These are big (20 pixels) monospaced and proportional fonts in BDF format
(used in X-windows) and koi8-r encoding (same as ASCII as far as
U.S. English is concerned).  I wrote them for my new high-resolution laptop
for which the existing fonts became too small.  The ASCII part is heavily
influenced by the font "clean" by D. Schumacher (which I've been using so
far).  For the Russian part, I attempted a different look, so that letters
similar in Latin and Cyrillic would be easy to distinguish.  In addition to
the monospaced fonts monoell and monosimple, there are their "slightly
proportional" versions (propell and proposimple) for better readability when
desired.

2/21/03: Included smaller monospace fonts rusclean* (13 and 15 pixel), which
combine two old public domain X-windows fonts (Latin glyphs from "clean",
Cyrillic glyphs from "sq01").

4/29/03: Changed several glyphs in the Russian part of the mono* and propo*
fonts.
